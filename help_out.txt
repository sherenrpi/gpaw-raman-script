    tations=ori
    ginal,
    these will
    contain a
    second axis

    (this
    dependence
    arises from

  --shift-type {stokes,anti-stokes}
    selects
    sign of the

    IMPORTANT:
    results of
    --shift-
    type 'anti-
    stokes' are
    not
    physical as
    they do not
    account for
    the

    states
    (there is
    no

    the purpose
    of this

    factor and

    between

    diagonal

    Ulrik
    Leffer's

    ANTLY
