## A modified version of the original resonant Raman script by Michael Lamparski (see link below). 
## This version includes functionality to save the calculated force constants for later post-processing.

# gpaw-raman-script

Implements https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16529-6

(Note: since starting development on this, gpaw now also has its own implementation of this method [currently in development](https://gitlab.com/gpaw/gpaw/-/merge_requests/822), but it doesn't allow symmetry-reduced displacements)
